## Errors (Runtime)

- Multiple scanner issues in "cart" methods
- Conceptually, our team followed the Scanner structure to the precise detail, however, 'no line found' exceptions still arise when removing books from the customer's carts and clearing them
- Adding books to the cart works, but you'll most likely find another issue that happens even when commenting out the firstRemove() and clearMyCart() methods... it doesn't allow you to purchase because another Scanner issue comes up
- Formatting of this specific exception will often appear as follows:

-- Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found
        at java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1540)
        at Customer.firstRemove(Customer.java:116)
        at BookShop.main(BookShop.java:318)

- To Avoid Reaching The Above Exception, always choose Option 2 (Purchasing Directly) to run the program all the way through

- Worked alongside a Computer Science student, David Sohn, who showed me how to identify a number in a String using (String).matches(".*\\d.*")
- Used geeksforgeeks.org for guidance using the LocalDate package

- stackoverflow.com was used to find a method to calculate the time elapsed between 2 dates

- ChatGPT was used to error check and make corrections within the createBooksToAdd() method inside of the Administrator.java class. 
     Roughly 60-70% of that specific code was originally written by us
- Did some research on Scanner objects to see how we could implement them more neatly
